1. HARDWARE -
   - CPU - Core
   - RAM - GB
   - Storage - GB

2. TECHNOLOGY -

- Frontend ->
  React

- Backend ->
  NodeJS

- DataBase ->
  MySQL

3. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS -
   - Code Editor - VS Code
   - Browser
   - Windows OS
   - NodeJS
   - MySQL server 8.0
   - Postman - for API testing
   - Git/Github - for code manage, track code changes, maintain version history, collaborate with others, and safely store the project source code online

4. DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS -
   - Windows OS
   - Browser
   - NodeJS
   - MySQL server 8.0

5. DATABASE DESIGN -
   - How the data will be stored (tables, columns, relations).
   - Ex. Product table, Purchase table, Sales table

6. Why need software -

   ##### To Maintain complete accounting records of the grocery store -
   - What items were purchased?
   - What was their price and in what quantity?
   - What items were sold each day?
   - What was the profit margin?
   - Daily and monthly profit and sales reports

7. What will the software do -
   - Project management(add, update, delete products)
   - Parchase entry and stock update
   - Sales and billing management
   - Automatic stock increase and decrease
   - Profit and margin calculation
   - Report generation

8. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE -
   - User -> Frontend -> Backend -> DataBase -> Response -> User

9. MODULE (Parts of software) -
   - Products module - Manages products details
   - Purchase module - records incoming stock
   - Sales module - Handles billings and sales transactions

10. BUSINESS LOGIC -
    - Stock increases when items are purchased
    - Stock decreases when items are sold
    - Profit is calculated using the formula: Profit = Selling Price − Purchase Price
    - (5/10 = 95/100 - 90)

11. TESTING -
    - Using software to find fault

12. DEPLOYMENT (?) -
    - Run on a local computer or host on a server.

13. Why software is useful -
    - Ex. Time is saved,
    - Accurate profit calculations,
    - Manual work is reduced
    - Manual work is reduced
